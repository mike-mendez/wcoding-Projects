The Consulate General of South Korea in Japan's Fukuoka prefecture created an uproar on July 8, the day when Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated by an unemployed 41-year-old Japanese man named Tetsuya Yamagami. After the shocking news, South Korea's Consulate General uploaded a social media post warning Koreans in Japan about their safety, mentioning the possibility of anti-Korean hate crimes. It encouraged Koreans to stay safe and call the police or the consulate if they feel their safety is in danger. The social media post raised eyebrows of both South Koreans and Japanese. Japanese, who were aware of the social media post, complained that the South Korean consulate general was treating Japanese people as potential criminals, while some called it hate speech. South Koreans were also left scratching their heads.
